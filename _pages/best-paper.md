# Best Paper Awards

The Best Paper Awards recognise many of the outstanding papers appearing at EACL 2021. We considered for these awards both long and short papers.

The main paper awards were selected as follows:

- Based on paper reviews, the opinions of the area chair, and the senior area chair(s), we constructed a short-list of strong papers. We ensured that the short-list contained papers of a diversity of different types: e.g., resources papers, theory papers, papers from most of the conference tracks, and short and long format papers.
- The short-listed papers were sent to a Best Paper committee for further review, from which the overall top papers were awarded honourable mentions and best paper.
  
The following papers have been given awards.
